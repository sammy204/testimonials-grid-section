  I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br> were current, if not more so, 
  in the company I joined. <br>I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth. </p>
  <h3 class="daniel-text">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a <br>
  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
  for<br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
  The next 12<br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
  the course, I’ve <br>successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</h3>

    <p>
      
  Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp <br>themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
  learning from <br>their experiences was easy.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <h3>
  “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The <br>program 
  gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present<br> myself as a capable 
  junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the <br>personal attention you need from 
  an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</h3>

  <h2> Kira Whittle<br>
  <span>Verified Graduate</span></h2>

<p>
  Such a life-changing<br> experience. Highly<br> recommended!</p>
<h3>
  “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br>never written a line of code. I needed <br>some structure from 
  professionals<br> who can help me learn programming<br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br>enroll by a former 
  student of theirs<br> who can only say wonderful things<br> about the program. The entire <br>curriculum and staff 
  did not<br> disappoint. They were very hands-on<br> and I never had to wait long for <br>assistance. The agile team 
  project, in<br> particular, was outstanding. It took<br> my learning to the next level in a way <br>that no tutorial 
  could ever have. In<br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br>interviews as an example of my<br> developent 
  experience. It certainly<br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>developer after receiving multiple <br>offers. 
  100% recommend! ”</h3>
